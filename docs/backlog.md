1) Add box score to each game after it is played
2) Update player stats after each game - add player stats to the player modal and when going into a teams page, show their stats like how ESPN does it
2a) Stats aren't tracking at all for regular season and playoffs
3) Update the text on modals to be more concise and easier to read along when drafting, the textbox is white and the text is barely visible
4) is there an in-game play by play simulation that can be done and watched?
5) Trade evaluation doesn't work or isn't implemented.  Determine a scoring method is is rigid but fair so no team rips off another
